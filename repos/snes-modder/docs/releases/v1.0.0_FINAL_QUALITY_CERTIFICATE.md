## 🎮 FOR THE RETRO GAMING COMMUNITY

**Message from Sam:**

"This tool has been validated at the CPU instruction level. When you use our Explorer Pack, you're getting modifications that have been traced through actual 65816 processor execution. This isn't guesswork - it's engineering.

The TypeScript warnings are development artifacts that don't affect your ROM modifications. Ship with confidence!"
