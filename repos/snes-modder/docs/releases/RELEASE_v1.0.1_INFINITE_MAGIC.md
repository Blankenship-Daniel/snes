# ðŸŽ® v1.0.1 - INFINITE MAGIC UPDATE!

## âš¡ NEW PRESET: Infinite Magic

**SHIP IT!** Our first gameplay mod is here!

### What's New:

**`infinite-magic` preset** - Never run out of magic power!
- ðŸ”® **Infinite magic consumption** - Fire Rod spam all day!
- âœ¨ **Full magic bar** to start
- ðŸ”¥ **All magic items included**:
  - Fire Rod
  - Ice Rod  
  - Bombos Medallion
  - Ether Medallion
  - Quake Medallion

### How It Works:

We set the magic consumption rate (`0xF37B`) to ZERO! 
- Normal gameplay: Each spell decrements magic
- With our mod: Magic never decreases!

### Perfect For:

- **Speedrunners** - No magic management needed
- **Casual players** - Spam those screen-clearing medallions
- **Testing** - Try all magic items without limits
- **Fun** - Because who doesn't love unlimited power?

### Usage:

```bash
npm run instant-mod zelda3.smc infinite-magic
```

### Technical Details:

**Memory addresses modified:**
- `0xF36E` - Magic power (set to 0x80 = full)
- `0xF37B` - Magic consumption (set to 0x00 = infinite!)
- `0xF345-0xF349` - Magic items given

**Validation:**
- âœ… Tested with Fire Rod rapid fire
- âœ… Medallions work without draining magic
- âœ… No side effects on other gameplay

### What's Next:

- Infinite Arrows
- Infinite Bombs
- One-Hit Boss Kills
