## Critical Success Factors Documented

### 1. Save Template Discovery (The Foundation)
**Breakthrough Insight:** ROM contains templates that get copied to RAM during initialization
- Location: 0x274C6 (without header)
- Impact: Enables persistent item/stat modifications for all new games
- Safety Level: Very High (no runtime conflicts)

### 2. Speed Table Discovery (The Performance Enhancement)
**Breakthrough Insight:** Movement speeds controlled by 27-entry lookup table
- Location: 0x3E228 (without header)  
- Impact: Enables gameplay speed modifications without glitches
- Safety Level: High (2x multiplier proven safe)

### 3. Magic Cost Discovery (The Gameplay Enhancement)
**Breakthrough Insight:** Single function controls all magic consumption validation
- Location: 0x07B0AB (without header)
- Impact: Enables infinite magic with 2-byte assembly patch
- Safety Level: Medium (requires assembly knowledge)

## Technical Architecture Preserved

### Type-Safe Development Patterns
```typescript
// Prevents offset calculation errors
import { OffsetCalculator, ROMOffset } from '../src/lib/ROMOffsets';

const templateOffset = OffsetCalculator.getSaveTemplateItemOffset(0x2C, hasHeader);
// Type system ensures safe offset calculation
```

### Production-Ready Implementation Patterns  
```typescript
// Reliable modification patterns
const quickStart = new QuickStartMod('./zelda3.smc');
quickStart.apply(MODIFICATION_PRESETS.EXPLORER_PACK);
quickStart.save('./zelda3-enhanced.smc');
```

### Maintainable Documentation Patterns
```typescript
// Future-proof discovery tracking
const OFFSET_CATEGORIES: ReadonlyArray<OffsetCategory> = [
  { name: 'SAVE_TEMPLATE', baseOffset: ROMOffset(0x274C6), /* ... */ },
  // Extensible for future discoveries
] as const;
```
