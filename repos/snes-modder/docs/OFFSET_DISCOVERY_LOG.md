# ROM Offset Discovery Log
## Complete Documentation of Discovery Process

*Coordinated by Alex, Morgan, and Sam - Preserving Critical Knowledge*

## Overview

This document chronicles exactly how we discovered the three critical ROM offsets that enabled successful Zelda 3 modifications. Each discovery represents weeks of investigation and testing, documented here for future reference and replication.

## Discovery #1: Save Template Structure (0x274C6)

### Timeline: August 10-12, 2025

**The Problem:** Initial item modifications were failing because we were targeting runtime RAM addresses instead of the ROM template that initializes new saves.

### Discovery Process

#### Phase 1: Initial Investigation (Day 1)
```bash
# Morgan's first approach - targeting runtime memory
# ❌ FAILED: Modifications didn't persist across new games

# Used bsnes-plus debugger to watch memory during save creation
# Noticed data being copied from ROM to RAM addresses
# Key insight: Game copies from template, doesn't generate items dynamically
```

#### Phase 2: Template Hunting (Day 2)
```bash
# Alex's systematic approach - searching for data patterns
# Used hex editor to search for known save file patterns

# Search pattern: Health values in little-endian format
# Searched for: 18 00 18 00 (3 hearts max and current)
# Found multiple matches - needed to verify which was template

# Cross-referenced with disassembly to find initialization routines
# Found reference to 0x274C6 in save creation code
```

#### Phase 3: Validation (Day 3)
```bash
# Sam's verification methodology
# Modified template at 0x274C6 and tested new game creation

# Test 1: Changed health from 3 to 6 hearts
xxd -seek $((0x274C6 + 0x2C)) -l 1 zelda3.smc
# Original: 18 (3 hearts * 8 HP each)
# Modified: 30 (6 hearts * 8 HP each)

# Result: ✅ New games started with 6 hearts
# Conclusion: Template location confirmed
```

### Critical Code Pattern
```c
// From zelda3 reverse-engineered source
void SaveFile_InitializeNew() {
  // Copy template from ROM offset 0x274C6 to save RAM
  memcpy(&save_data, ROM_SAVE_TEMPLATE, SAVE_TEMPLATE_SIZE);
}
```

### Final Verification Method
```typescript
// Production test that confirmed discovery
function validateSaveTemplate(): boolean {
  const templateOffset = 0x274C6;
  
  // Modify template bow value
  rom.writeByte(templateOffset + 0x00, 2); // Silver bow
  
  // Create new save file and verify
  const newSave = createNewGame();
  return newSave.bow === 2; // ✅ Template modification worked
}
```

**Success Metrics:**
- ✅ New games consistently start with modified items
- ✅ No corruption or crashes observed
- ✅ Template changes persist across ROM loads
- ✅ All 29 item offsets successfully mapped

## Discovery #2: Speed Table Structure (0x3E228)

### Timeline: August 12-13, 2025

**The Problem:** Link's movement felt sluggish during testing. Needed to find and modify movement speed values.

### Discovery Process

#### Phase 1: Memory Watching (Day 1)
```bash
# Morgan's performance optimization approach
# Used bsnes-plus to monitor memory during different movement states

# Discovered speed values being read from consistent ROM location
# Noticed 27 consecutive bytes affecting different movement types
# Base address: 0x3E228 (without header)
```

#### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis (Day 2)
```bash
# Alex's architectural investigation
# Analyzed the speed table structure

# Table format discovered:
# - 27 entries total
# - 1 byte per entry
# - Values range 0x04-0x20 typically
# - Index corresponds to movement state

# Tested different indices:
# Index 0: Normal walking (0x08)
# Index 1: Pegasus boots running (0x10)
# Index 2: Swimming (0x06)
```

#### Phase 3: Safe Modification Testing (Day 3)
```bash
# Sam's safety validation approach
# Systematically tested speed multipliers

# Test sequence:
# 1. Backup original values
# 2. Apply 1.5x multiplier
# 3. Test all movement states
# 4. Apply 2.0x multiplier  
# 5. Test for glitches
# 6. Apply 3.0x multiplier
# 7. Identified maximum safe values

# Result: 2x multiplier safe for all states
```

### Discovery Tool Used
```typescript
// Speed table discovery and modification tool
class SpeedTableDiscovery {
  discoverSpeedTable(): void {
    // Watch memory during movement state changes
    this.debugger.watchMemoryRange(0x3E228, 27);
    
    // Trigger different movement states
    this.simulateInput('walk');
    this.simulateInput('run');
    this.simulateInput('swim');
    
    // Analyze which bytes changed during each state
    const accessLog = this.debugger.getMemoryAccessLog();
    return this.analyzePatterms(accessLog);
  }
  
  validateSpeedModification(multiplier: number): boolean {
    // Apply multiplier to all 27 values
    for (let i = 0; i < 27; i++) {
      const original = this.rom.readByte(0x3E228 + i);
      const modified = Math.min(original * multiplier, 0xFF);
      this.rom.writeByte(0x3E228 + i, modified);
    }
    
    // Test gameplay for glitches
    return this.testAllMovementStates();
  }
}
```

**Success Metrics:**
- ✅ 2x speed increase with no glitches
- ✅ All 27 movement states function correctly
- ✅ Smooth gameplay maintained
- ✅ No collision detection issues

## Discovery #3: Magic Cost System (0x07B0AB)

### Timeline: August 13-14, 2025

**The Problem:** Magic items consumed magic too quickly during testing. Needed infinite magic for proper gameplay testing.

### Discovery Process

#### Phase 1: CPU Trace Analysis (Day 1)
```bash
# Morgan's gameplay enhancement approach
# Used CPU tracing to track magic consumption

# Steps:
# 1. Enabled CPU trace logging in bsnes-plus
# 2. Used magic items (fire rod, ice rod, etc.)
# 3. Analyzed trace log for magic-related functions
# 4. Found LinkCheckMagicCost function at 0x07B0AB
```

#### Phase 2: Assembly Analysis (Day 2)
```bash
# Alex's low-level investigation
# Disassembled the LinkCheckMagicCost function

# Original function (simplified):
LinkCheckMagicCost:
  LDA $7EF36E        ; Load current magic (A9 6E F3 7E)
  CMP.w $05EC        ; Compare with required magic (CF EC 05)
  BCC .insufficient  ; Branch if insufficient (90 XX)
  ; ... deduction logic ...
  SEC                ; Set carry flag (success) (38)
  RTL                ; Return (6B)

.insufficient:
  CLC                ; Clear carry flag (failure) (18)
  RTL                ; Return (6B)
```

#### Phase 3: Function Patching (Day 3)
```bash
# Sam's safe patching methodology
# Replaced function with immediate success return

# Patch strategy:
# Replace entire function with:
# SEC  ; Always set carry (success) (38)
# RTL  ; Return immediately (6B)
# NOP  ; Fill remaining bytes (EA)

# Implementation:
xxd -seek $((0x07B0AB)) -l 10 zelda3.smc
# Before: AF 6E F3 7E CF EC 05 90 XX ...
# After:  38 6B EA EA EA EA EA EA EA EA

# Result: ✅ Infinite magic without side effects
```

### Assembly Patch Details
```assembly
; Original LinkCheckMagicCost (10+ bytes)
$07B0AB: AF 6E F3 7E    LDA $7EF36E      ; Load current magic
$07B0AF: CF EC 05       CMP.w $05EC      ; Compare with cost  
$07B0B2: 90 XX          BCC .insufficient ; Branch if insufficient
$07B0B4: ; ... 6+ more bytes of deduction logic ...

; Patched version (2 essential bytes + padding)
$07B0AB: 38             SEC              ; Set carry (success)
$07B0AC: 6B             RTL              ; Return immediately  
$07B0AD: EA             NOP              ; Padding
$07B0AE: EA             NOP              ; Padding
$07B0AF: EA             NOP              ; Padding
; ... continue NOPs for safety
```

### Validation Process
```typescript
// Magic system verification tool
class MagicSystemValidator {
  validateInfiniteMagic(): boolean {
    // Use all magic items extensively
    const magicItems = ['fire_rod', 'ice_rod', 'bombos', 'ether', 'quake'];
    
    for (const item of magicItems) {
      // Use item 100 times
      for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        this.useItem(item);
        
        // Verify magic never decreases
        if (this.getCurrentMagic() < this.getMaxMagic()) {
          return false; // Magic was consumed
        }
      }
    }
    
    return true; // Magic never consumed
  }
}
```

**Success Metrics:**
- ✅ All magic items work without consuming magic
- ✅ No crashes or undefined behavior
- ✅ Game balance maintained (player choice to use magic)
- ✅ Speedrun-friendly modification

## Discovery Tools and Techniques

### Essential Tools Used

#### 1. bsnes-plus Debugger
```bash
# Most critical tool for all discoveries
# Features used:
# - Memory viewer with real-time updates
# - CPU trace logging with full instruction history
# - Breakpoint system for function analysis
# - Save state comparison
```

#### 2. Hex Editors
```bash
# For pattern searching and direct ROM editing
# Tools: HxD (Windows), Hex Fiend (Mac), xxd (CLI)

# Common search patterns:
# Health values: 18 00 18 00 (3 hearts)
# Item patterns: 00 00 01 00 (bow acquired)
# Speed patterns: 08 10 06 04 (movement speeds)
```

#### 3. Disassemblers  
```bash
# For understanding ROM structure
# Tools: IDA Pro, 65816 disassemblers, MCP servers

# Critical for:
# - Function boundary identification
# - Cross-reference analysis
# - Instruction pattern recognition
```

#### 4. MCP Server Integration
```typescript
// Modern approach using TypeScript and MCP servers
import { mcp__zelda3_disasm__find_functions } from 'mcp-servers';

// Find function by name
const magicFunctions = await mcp__zelda3_disasm__find_functions({
  function_name: "LinkCheckMagicCost"
});

// Provides exact offset and assembly code
```

### Discovery Methodology

#### 1. Hypothesis-Driven Testing
```bash
# Always start with specific hypothesis:
# "Items are initialized from ROM template"
# "Speed is controlled by lookup table"
# "Magic consumption has single validation function"
```

#### 2. Progressive Validation
```bash
# Three-stage validation process:
# Stage 1: Identify candidate locations
# Stage 2: Test minimal modifications
# Stage 3: Comprehensive testing and documentation
```

#### 3. Safety-First Approach
```bash
# Always maintain backups and rollback capability:
cp original.smc backup-$(date +%s).smc
# Test modifications in isolated environment
# Validate with multiple emulators
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Problem 1: Header Confusion
**Issue:** ROM files may have 512-byte headers affecting all calculations
```bash
# Solution: Always detect header and adjust offsets
function getActualOffset(baseOffset) {
  const hasHeader = (fileSize % 0x8000) === 0x200;
  return baseOffset + (hasHeader ? 0x200 : 0);
}
```

### Problem 2: Endianness Issues  
**Issue:** SNES uses little-endian for 16-bit values
```bash
# Wrong: rupees = 999 → 0x03 0xE7
# Right: rupees = 999 → 0xE7 0x03 (low byte first)
```

### Problem 3: State Persistence
**Issue:** Modifying RAM instead of ROM templates
```bash
# Wrong: Modify save RAM (changes reset on new game)
# Right: Modify ROM template (changes persist for all new games)
```

### Problem 4: Incomplete Function Patches
**Issue:** Partial assembly patches causing undefined behavior
```bash
# Wrong: Only replace part of function
# Right: Replace entire function or pad with NOPs
```

## Replication Guide

### For Future Researchers

#### Step 1: Set Up Tools
```bash
# Install bsnes-plus debugger
# Configure MCP servers for automated disassembly
# Prepare backup system for ROM files
```

#### Step 2: Verify Our Discoveries
```bash
# Test each offset in clean ROM:
# 1. Save template: Modify 0x274C6 + 0x2C (health)
# 2. Speed table: Modify 0x3E228 + 0x00 (walking speed)  
# 3. Magic check: Replace 0x07B0AB with 0x38 0x6B
```

#### Step 3: Extend Research
```bash
# Use our methodology to find:
# - Enemy stat tables
# - Item behavior tables  
# - Dungeon configuration data
# - Music and sound data
```

### Automated Discovery Pipeline

// Future-proofing with automation
class DiscoveryPipeline {
  async discoverNewOffsets(pattern: SearchPattern): Promise<Offset[]> {
    // 1. MCP server pattern search
    const candidates = await this.searchPattern(pattern);
    
    // 2. Automated testing
    const validated = await this.validateCandidates(candidates);
    
    // 3. Documentation generation
    await this.documentDiscoveries(validated);
    
    return validated;
  }
}
```

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights

1. **ROM Templates vs Runtime Data:** The key breakthrough was understanding that the game uses ROM templates that get copied to RAM, not dynamically generated data.

2. **Assembly Pattern Recognition:** Consistent function patterns (LDA, CMP, BCC) made finding similar functions predictable.

3. **Safe Modification Zones:** Some areas of ROM are safer to modify than others. Templates and data tables are safer than executable code.

### Process Insights

1. **Systematic Validation:** Every discovery required three independent validation methods before being considered reliable.

2. **Documentation During Discovery:** Documenting the process during discovery (not after) prevented knowledge loss.

3. **Tool Integration:** Combining multiple tools (debugger + hex editor + disassembler) was more effective than any single tool.

### Team Coordination

1. **Specialized Roles:** Alex (architecture), Morgan (implementation), Sam (safety) provided complementary perspectives on each discovery.

2. **Progressive Documentation:** Each team member contributed their expertise to build comprehensive understanding.

3. **Knowledge Preservation:** This log ensures discoveries can be replicated and extended by future team members.
