# Zelda 3 Modder v1.1.1

Release date: 2025-10-18

## Patch Summary
- Docs: centralized under `docs/` with clear structure (`guides/`, `reports/`, `policies/`)
- Docs: added `docs/guides/index.md` and updated cross-links throughout
- Lint: absolute-path check now prints offending matches to make CI actionable
- MCP: `.mcp.json` no longer hard-codes absolute `cwd` (portable across machines/CI)

## Details
- docs: move and organize guides/reports/policies; add docs/README with conventions
- docs: fix links in guides, reports, and tools to new paths
- lint: restore visible `rg` matches in `tools/check-no-absolute-paths.sh`
- mcp: remove absolute `cwd` from `.mcp.json`; use repo-relative args

## Validation
- Absolute-path lint: passes locally
- Validation scripts: still generate and verify ROMs
- Runtime validator: unchanged since 1.1.0; prior tests remain successful

## Upgrade Notes
- No breaking changes; existing commands unaffected
- Docs moved â€” see `docs/guides/index.md` for entry points
