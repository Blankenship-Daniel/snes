# Automatic Learning Extraction

Your Claude Code sessions now automatically extract and store learnings in the Neo4j knowledge graph!

## Overview

When you end a Claude Code session, the **Stop hook** automatically:
1. âœ… Analyzes the conversation
2. âœ… Extracts key learnings using Codex CLI
3. âœ… Stores learnings in Neo4j as Knowledge nodes
4. âœ… Links learnings to relevant entities (Components, Mods, Registers)
5. âœ… Makes learnings available for future RAG retrieval

## What Gets Extracted

### Types of Learnings

**1. Implementations** (`type: implementation`)
- Code that was written
- Files that were modified
- New features added
- Components created

**2. Technical Decisions** (`type: decision`)
- Architecture choices made
- Approaches selected
- Trade-offs considered
- Why certain solutions were chosen

**3. Domain Knowledge** (`type: knowledge`)
- SNES hardware insights
- Register usage patterns
- Memory mapping details
- Best practices learned

**4. Best Practices** (`type: best_practice`)
- Patterns that worked well
- Pitfalls avoided
- Lessons learned
- Optimization techniques

### Learning Structure

Each learning contains:
```json
{
  "topic": "Brief 5-10 word title",
  "content": "1-2 sentence description of what was learned",
  "type": "implementation|decision|knowledge|best_practice",
  "entities": ["player", "$2100", "infinite-magic"],
  "tags": ["magic", "zelda3", "implementation"],
  "session_id": "20250118_143022",
  "created": "2025-01-18T14:30:45Z",
  "source": "session_extraction"
}
```

### Codex-Based Extraction

The system uses Codex CLI to analyze the session and extract:

**Prompt sent to Codex:**
```
Analyze this Claude Code session and extract key learnings.

For each learning, identify:
1. Topic: A concise 5-10 word title
2. Content: 1-2 sentences describing what was learned
3. Type: implementation, decision, knowledge, or best_practice
4. Entities: SNES components, registers, mods, projects mentioned
5. Tags: Relevant keywords

Focus on:
- Code implementations (what was built)
- Technical decisions (why certain approaches chosen)
- SNES domain knowledge (hardware insights)
- Best practices discovered
- Pitfalls avoided
```

### Git-Based Extraction

Analyzes file changes to extract:
- Modified components
- Updated tools
- Documentation changes

## Example Learnings

### Example 1: Implementation

**Session Activity:**
- Built RAG pipeline integration
- Modified user_prompt_submit.py hook
- Created neo4j_rag.py module

**Extracted Learning:**
```
Topic: RAG Pipeline Integration with Neo4j
Content: Integrated Neo4j knowledge graph with Claude Code hooks to
         automatically inject relevant context from graph queries based
         on user prompts. Used keyword extraction and semantic matching.
Type: implementation
Entities: ["user_prompt_submit", "neo4j_rag", "neo4j"]
Tags: ["rag", "neo4j", "integration", "hooks"]
```

### Example 2: Decision

**Session Activity:**
- Discussed different approaches to context retrieval
- Chose graph-based over vector-based search

**Extracted Learning:**
```
Topic: Graph-based Context Retrieval Choice
Content: Selected Neo4j graph queries over vector embeddings for RAG
         because explicit relationships provide more reliable context
         for SNES domain-specific questions.
Type: decision
Entities: ["neo4j", "rag"]
Tags: ["architecture", "decision", "rag", "retrieval"]
```

### Example 3: Domain Knowledge

**Session Activity:**
- Discussed PPU register usage
- Explained sprite rendering pipeline

**Extracted Learning:**
```
Topic: PPU Sprite Register Usage Pattern
Content: Sprites on SNES require setting up OAM via $2102/$2103 registers,
         then configuring sprite size with $2101 OBJSEL register during
         V-blank for proper rendering.
Type: knowledge
Entities: ["$2102", "$2103", "$2101", "ppu", "sprite_system"]
Tags: ["ppu", "sprites", "registers", "hardware"]
```

### Example 4: Best Practice

**Session Activity:**
- Discovered graceful degradation pattern
- Implemented fallback when Neo4j unavailable

**Extracted Learning:**
```
Topic: Graceful Degradation for Neo4j Integration
Content: Always check Neo4j availability and silently degrade when
         unavailable rather than breaking the hook. This ensures
         Claude Code continues working even if graph is down.
Type: best_practice
Entities: ["neo4j"]
Tags: ["best-practice", "reliability", "hooks"]
```

## Retrieval via RAG

Learnings become part of your knowledge graph and are automatically retrieved:

**Your question:**
```
How do I implement a RAG pipeline?
```

**RAG retrieves your learning:**
```
ðŸ§  Neo4j Knowledge Graph Context:

ðŸ“š Domain Knowledge:
  - RAG Pipeline Integration with Neo4j: Integrated Neo4j knowledge
    graph with Claude Code hooks to automatically inject relevant
    context from graph queries...

  - Graceful Degradation for Neo4j Integration: Always check Neo4j
    availability and silently degrade when unavailable...
```

## Querying Stored Learnings

### Neo4j Browser

```cypher
// Get all learnings from last session
MATCH (k:Knowledge)
WHERE k.source = 'session_extraction'
  AND k.created > datetime() - duration({hours: 24})
RETURN k.topic, k.content, k.type, k.tags
ORDER BY k.created DESC

// Find implementation learnings
MATCH (k:Knowledge {type: 'implementation'})
RETURN k.topic, k.content
ORDER BY k.created DESC
LIMIT 10

// Learnings about specific entity
MATCH (k:Knowledge)-[:DOCUMENTS]->(e)
WHERE e.name = 'player'
RETURN k.topic, k.content, k.type
```

### Python API

```python
from tools.neo4j_query_examples import SNESGraphQuery

query = SNESGraphQuery('bolt://localhost:7687', 'neo4j', 'snes-graph-2024')

# Get recent learnings
recent = query.execute_query("""
    MATCH (k:Knowledge)
    WHERE k.source = 'session_extraction'
      AND k.created > datetime() - duration({days: 7})
    RETURN k.topic as topic, k.content as content,
           k.type as type, k.tags as tags
    ORDER BY k.created DESC
""")

for learning in recent:
    print(f"{learning['topic']} ({learning['type']})")
    print(f"  {learning['content']}")
```

## Configuration

### Enable/Disable

Learning extraction is **automatically enabled** if:
1. âœ… Codex CLI is installed (`which codex`)
2. âœ… Neo4j is running
3. âœ… Environment variables are set

To **disable**:
- Stop Neo4j: `./tools/neo4j-docker.sh stop`
- Or unset `NEO4J_PASSWORD`

The hook gracefully degrades - if Codex or Neo4j unavailable, session still exports normally.

### Customize Extraction

Edit `tools/learning_extractor.py` to customize:

**Adjust extraction prompt:**
```python
def extract_learnings_with_codex(self, context: str = None):
    prompt = """Your custom extraction instructions here..."""
```

**Add custom learning types:**
```python
# In _parse_codex_output
if type_val in ['implementation', 'decision', 'knowledge',
                'best_practice', 'my_custom_type']:
    learning["type"] = type_val
```

**Change entity linking:**
```python
# In LearningStorage.store_learning
# Add more node types to link to
OPTIONAL MATCH (p:Project) WHERE toLower(p.name) CONTAINS toLower($entity)
```

## Testing

### Test Extraction

```bash
# Create a test session file
echo "# Test Session

## Summary
Built RAG pipeline integration.
" > test_session.md

# Run extraction
python3 tools/learning_extractor.py test_session.md
```

### Verify Storage

```bash
# Query Neo4j for recent learnings
python3 -c "
from tools.neo4j_query_examples import SNESGraphQuery
query = SNESGraphQuery('bolt://localhost:7687', 'neo4j', 'snes-graph-2024')
learnings = query.execute_query('''
    MATCH (k:Knowledge)
    WHERE k.source = \"session_extraction\"
    RETURN k.topic, k.created
    ORDER BY k.created DESC
    LIMIT 5
''')
for l in learnings:
    print(l['topic'])
"
```

## Viewing Learnings

### In Next Session

Your learnings automatically appear via RAG:

```
User: How did I implement the RAG pipeline?

ðŸ§  Neo4j Knowledge Graph Context:
ðŸ“š Domain Knowledge:
  - RAG Pipeline Integration with Neo4j: Integrated Neo4j knowledge
    graph with Claude Code hooks...
```

### Via Neo4j Browser

Visit http://localhost:7474 and run:

```cypher
// Visualize learning relationships
MATCH (k:Knowledge {source: 'session_extraction'})-[r]->(entity)
RETURN k, r, entity
LIMIT 50
```

### Via Session Logs

Check `.claude/sessions/` for exported sessions with learnings listed.

## Benefits

### Continuous Learning
- Every session adds to your knowledge base
- Learnings accumulate over time
- Build institutional memory

### Improved Context
- RAG retrieves your past learnings
- No need to remember details
- Context-aware responses

### Knowledge Sharing

- Document decisions automatically
- Track implementation history

### Better Recommendations
- Claude sees what worked before
- Suggests similar approaches
- Avoids past mistakes

## Examples in Practice

### After Building RAG Pipeline

**Next session query:**
```
How do I add more keyword detection to RAG?
```

**Retrieved learning:**
```
RAG Pipeline Integration: Used keyword extraction with
configurable lists in neo4j_rag.py. Add keywords to
mod_keywords, hardware_keywords arrays...
```

### After Modding Session

**Next session query:**
```
How do I create a new mod?
```

**Retrieved learning:**
```
Mod Creation Pattern: Created infinite-magic mod by modifying
player.c, changed 7 bytes. Use add_mod() to store in Neo4j...
```

## Troubleshooting

### No learnings extracted?

**Check Codex:**
```bash
which codex
# Should show path to codex
```

**Check session content:**
```bash
cat .claude/sessions/latest_session.md
# Should have conversation content
```

### Learnings not stored?

**Check Neo4j:**
```bash
./tools/neo4j-docker.sh status
# Should show "Neo4j is running"
```

**Check environment:**
```bash
echo $NEO4J_PASSWORD
# Should show password
```

### Want more verbose output?

Check stop hook logs:
```bash
tail -f .claude/sessions/*/logs/*.log | grep "learning"
```

## Advanced Usage

### Manual Extraction

```bash
# Extract from any session file
python3 tools/learning_extractor.py .claude/sessions/20250118_143022_session.md
```

### Batch Process Old Sessions

```python
from pathlib import Path
from tools.learning_extractor import extract_and_store_session_learnings

sessions_dir = Path(".claude/sessions")
for session_file in sessions_dir.glob("*_session.md"):
    print(f"Processing {session_file}...")
    results = extract_and_store_session_learnings(session_file)
    print(f"  Extracted {results['learnings_extracted']} learnings")
```

### Export Learnings

```bash
# Export all session learnings to JSON
python3 -c "
from tools.neo4j_query_examples import SNESGraphQuery
import json

query = SNESGraphQuery('bolt://localhost:7687', 'neo4j', 'snes-graph-2024')
learnings = query.execute_query('''
    MATCH (k:Knowledge)
    WHERE k.source = \"session_extraction\"
    RETURN k.topic, k.content, k.type, k.tags, k.created
''')
print(json.dumps(learnings, indent=2, default=str))
"
```

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:
- Semantic deduplication (merge similar learnings)
- Confidence scoring (how certain is the extraction)
- Learning evolution tracking (how learnings change over time)
- Cross-session relationship discovery
- Automatic tagging improvement via embeddings
