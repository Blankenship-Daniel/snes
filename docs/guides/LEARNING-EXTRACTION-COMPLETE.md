### What Gets Extracted

**4 Types of Learnings:**

1. **Implementations** - Code written, files modified, features added
2. **Decisions** - Architecture choices, approaches selected, trade-offs
3. **Knowledge** - SNES hardware insights, register usage, domain expertise
4. **Best Practices** - Patterns that worked, pitfalls avoided, lessons learned

## üìÅ Files Created

```
tools/learning_extractor.py           # Core extraction logic

```

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Intelligent Extraction

Uses **Codex CLI** to analyze conversations and extract:
- What was built (implementations)
- Why decisions were made (rationale)
- What was learned (knowledge)
- What works well (best practices)

### Entity Linking

Automatically links learnings to:
- **Components** - `player`, `sprite_system`, etc.
- **Mods** - `infinite-magic`, `2x-speed`, etc.
- **Registers** - `$2100`, `$4200`, etc.
- **Projects** - `zelda3`, `bsnes-plus`, etc.

### RAG Integration

Learnings automatically appear in future sessions via RAG:

**Your question:**
```
How did I implement the RAG pipeline?
```

**RAG retrieves your learning:**
```
üß† Neo4j Knowledge Graph Context:

üìö Domain Knowledge:
  - RAG Pipeline Integration: Integrated Neo4j knowledge graph
    with Claude Code hooks to automatically inject relevant
    context from graph queries based on user prompts...
```

## üéØ Example Session

### What You Do
```
# Build RAG integration
# Modify hooks
# Create new modules
# End session
```

### What Gets Extracted

**Session ends, stop hook runs:**

```
üìù Exporting Session
============================================================
‚úÖ Session exported to: .claude/sessions/20250118_143022_session.md
‚úÖ Session index updated

üß† Extracting session learnings...
‚úÖ Extracted 4 learnings
‚úÖ Stored 4 learnings in knowledge graph

üìö Learnings captured:
  1. RAG Pipeline Integration (implementation)
  2. Graph Query vs Vector Search (decision)
  3. PPU Sprite Register Usage (knowledge)
  4. Graceful Degradation Pattern (best_practice)
============================================================
```

### What's Now in Neo4j

```cypher
// Query your learnings
MATCH (k:Knowledge)
WHERE k.source = 'session_extraction'
  AND k.created > datetime() - duration({hours: 24})
RETURN k.topic, k.content, k.type
```

**Results:**
```
1. RAG Pipeline Integration (implementation)
   Integrated Neo4j knowledge graph with Claude Code hooks...

2. Graph Query vs Vector Search (decision)
   Chose Neo4j graph queries over vector embeddings for
   better reliability...

3. PPU Sprite Register Usage (knowledge)
   Sprites require OAM setup via $2102/$2103 registers...

4. Graceful Degradation Pattern (best_practice)
   Always check Neo4j availability and degrade gracefully...
```

## üîß Usage

### Automatic (Default)

Learning extraction happens **automatically** when sessions end:
- ‚úÖ No configuration needed
- ‚úÖ Works if Codex installed
- ‚úÖ Works if Neo4j running
- ‚úÖ Degrades gracefully if not available

### Manual Extraction

```bash
# Extract from any session file
python3 tools/learning_extractor.py .claude/sessions/20250118_143022_session.md
```

### Test the System

```bash
# Run comprehensive test
./tools/test_learning_extraction.sh
```

### Query Learnings

```bash
# Interactive query
python3 tools/neo4j_query_examples.py --interactive

# In Neo4j Browser (http://localhost:7474)
MATCH (k:Knowledge {source: 'session_extraction'})
RETURN k.topic, k.content, k.type
ORDER BY k.created DESC
LIMIT 10
```

## üí° Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Building RAG Pipeline

**Session Activity:**
- Researched Exa for best practices
- Created neo4j_rag.py module
- Modified user_prompt_submit.py hook
- Tested keyword extraction

**Extracted Learnings:**

```
1. RAG Pipeline Implementation (implementation)
   Built RAG pipeline using Neo4j for graph-based context
   retrieval with smart keyword detection and entity linking.
   Entities: [neo4j_rag, user_prompt_submit]
   Tags: [rag, implementation, neo4j]

2. Keyword Extraction Approach (decision)
   Used explicit keyword lists instead of NLP for better control
   and reliability in SNES domain-specific context.
   Entities: [neo4j_rag]
   Tags: [design, decision, rag]
```

### Example 2: SNES Hardware Learning

**Session Activity:**
- Discussed PPU registers
- Explained sprite rendering
- Showed register usage patterns

**Extracted Learning:**

```
PPU Sprite Rendering Pipeline (knowledge)
SNES sprites require setting up Object Attribute Memory (OAM)
via $2102 (OAMADDL) and $2103 (OAMADDH) registers, then
configuring sprite size with $2101 (OBJSEL) during V-blank.
Entities: [$2102, $2103, $2101, ppu, sprite_system]
Tags: [ppu, sprites, registers, hardware, rendering]
```

### Example 3: Avoiding Pitfalls

**Session Activity:**
- Discovered hook failure issue
- Implemented graceful degradation
- Tested fallback behavior

**Extracted Learning:**
```
Graceful Hook Degradation (best_practice)
Claude Code hooks should always check dependency availability
(like Neo4j, Codex) and degrade gracefully rather than failing.
Use try/except blocks and optional features to ensure hooks
never break the user experience.
Entities: [stop, user_prompt_submit]
Tags: [best-practice, reliability, hooks, error-handling]
```

# Check recent learnings
python3 -c "
from tools.neo4j_query_examples import SNESGraphQuery

query = SNESGraphQuery('bolt://localhost:7687', 'neo4j', 'snes-graph-2024')
learnings = query.execute_query('''
    MATCH (k:Knowledge)
    WHERE k.source = \"session_extraction\"
    RETURN k.topic, k.created
    ORDER BY k.created DESC
    LIMIT 5
''')

for l in learnings:
    print(l['topic'])
"
```

### Check Stop Hook

## üéì Documentation

- **Complete Guide**: `docs/learning-extraction.md` (1000+ lines)
- **RAG Integration**: `docs/rag-integration.md`
- **Neo4j Guide**: `docs/neo4j-knowledge-graph.md`
- **Quick Reference**: This file!

## üõ†Ô∏è Management

```bash
# Test extraction
./tools/test_learning_extraction.sh

# Extract from session manually
python3 tools/learning_extractor.py .claude/sessions/SESSION_FILE.md

# Query learnings
python3 tools/neo4j_query_examples.py --interactive

# Browse visually
open http://localhost:7474
```

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Try it out**: End this session and watch extraction happen
2. **Check learnings**: Query Neo4j for captured knowledge
3. **Use RAG**: Ask questions and see learnings retrieved
4. **Read docs**: Check `docs/learning-extraction.md` for details

## üî• What Makes This Powerful

**Traditional Approach:**
- Write code
- Document separately (maybe)
- Forget details over time
- Repeat explanations

**With Learning Extraction:**
- ‚úÖ Write code
- ‚úÖ Auto-documented in knowledge graph
- ‚úÖ Always retrievable via RAG
- ‚úÖ Never explain twice
- ‚úÖ Knowledge compounds

**Result:** Your knowledge graph becomes smarter with every session!

## üìù Example Workflow

### Day 1: Build Feature
```
You: Help me build a 3x speed mod
Claude: [Helps build it]
[Session ends]
Stop Hook: Extracts "3x Speed Mod Implementation" learning
```

### Day 7: Similar Feature
```
You: How do I make a super jump mod?
RAG: [Retrieves 3x speed learning as reference]
Claude: Based on your 3x speed mod, here's how to do super jump...
```

### Day 30: Team Member Asks
```
Teammate: How did we implement speed mods?
You: Query the knowledge graph!
[Shows all speed-related learnings with context]
```
