# Bsnes Input-Command Formatting — Review Summary (2025-10-19)

## Summary
- Reviewer found no regressions in the updated input-command formatting for bsnes.
- The bsnes CLI parser lowercases inputs; behavior remains unchanged.

## Scope
- Affects bsnes invocation paths used by our validation/runtime scripts.
- No logic changes expected; only formatting/consistency adjustments.

## Validation Checklist
- Primary: `npm test` or `./scripts/validate-mods.sh` (ROM size/diff checks)
- Runtime: `./scripts/ultimate-runtime-validation.sh` (bsnes stability + input checks)

Prereqs: `bsnes`, `bc`, `xxd`, `cmp`, `timeout` on PATH and `zelda3.smc` at repo root.

## Expected Outcomes
- Validate script exits clean (no unexpected ROM size or binary diffs beyond known mods).
- Runtime validation completes without input-related errors or crashes.

## Risk & Rollback
- Risk: Low — parser behavior unchanged; formatting only.
- Rollback: Revert the input-command formatting commit to prior version.

## Notes
- If you encounter platform-specific quirks, document them under `docs/reports/` with a short snippet of the failure and environment details.
