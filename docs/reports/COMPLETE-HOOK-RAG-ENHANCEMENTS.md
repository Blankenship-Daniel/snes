# Complete Hook & RAG Enhancement Summary ✅

## 🎯 Mission Complete

Successfully identified and implemented **advanced RAG and Codex integration opportunities** across the Claude Code hook system, creating a state-of-the-art context enrichment pipeline.

## 📋 What Was Accomplished

### Phase 1: Research (Exa)
✅ Researched advanced RAG patterns:
  - Query expansion and reranking techniques
  - Semantic search with embeddings
  - Hybrid search (keyword + semantic fusion)
  - Real-time LLM context enrichment

### Phase 2: Hook Enhancements
✅ **Enhanced `user_prompt_submit` hook**:
  - Added Codex-powered query analysis
  - Implemented query expansion with SNES synonyms
  - Added recent file changes context
  - Multi-variation RAG queries for better coverage

✅ **Enhanced `pre_tool_use` hook** (from previous session):
  - RAG context injection before file operations
  - Codex file analysis before modifications
  - Past learnings retrieval

✅ **Enhanced `post_tool_use` hook** (from previous session):
  - Immediate learning extraction after changes
  - Codex change analysis
  - Automatic knowledge graph updates

### Phase 3: RAG Pipeline Enhancements
✅ **Enhanced `tools/neo4j_rag.py`**:
  - Multi-factor relevance scoring (4 factors, 0-20 points)
  - Intelligent reranking of all results
  - Better deduplication across types
  - Plus MCP server integration (auto-detected)

### Phase 4: Documentation
✅ Created comprehensive guides:
  - `ADVANCED-RAG-ENHANCEMENTS.md` (detailed technical guide)
  - `HOOK-ENHANCEMENT-COMPLETE.md` (from previous session)
  - `../guides/hook-integration-guide.md` (from previous session)

## 🔬 Technical Achievements

### 1. Codex-Powered Query Analysis

**Location**: `.claude/hooks/user_prompt_submit.py`

**What it does**:
- Analyzes user intent (implement, debug, explain, modify)
- Extracts main topics and entities
- Identifies related SNES concepts
- Guides query expansion

**Example**:
```
Query: "How to implement sprite priority?"

Codex Analysis:
  - Topics: sprite, priority, OAM
  - Intent: implement
  - Related: PPU, rendering, attribute bytes
```

### 2. Query Expansion System

**Location**: `.claude/hooks/user_prompt_submit.py`

**What it does**:
- Expands query with domain synonyms
- Generates up to 3 variations
- Increases RAG coverage
- Finds related content

**Example**:
```
Original: "DMA transfer setup"

Expanded:
  1. "DMA transfer setup"
  2. "DMA transfer setup copy"
  3. "DMA transfer setup channel"

All 3 queries retrieve context → combined results
```

### 3. Multi-Factor Relevance Scoring

**Location**: `tools/neo4j_rag.py`

**Scoring Factors**:
1. **Keyword matches** (0-10 pts): More matches = higher score
2. **Exact query match** (0-5 pts): Full query in content
3. **Keyword position** (0-3 pts): Earlier appearance = better
4. **Content richness** (0-2 pts): More content = more helpful

**Total**: 0-20 points per item

**Example**:
```
Item: OAM Address Register
Query: "sprite rendering"
Keywords: ["sprite", "rendering"]

Score:
  + 4 pts: 2 keyword matches (sprite, rendering)
  + 3 pts: "sprite" appears in first 50 chars
  + 2 pts: Content > 100 chars
  = 9/20 points
```

### 4. Intelligent Reranking

**Location**: `tools/neo4j_rag.py`

**How it works**:
1. Retrieve from all sources (mods, registers, components, knowledge)
2. Score every item (0-20 points)
3. Sort by relevance (highest first)
4. Return top N items regardless of type

**Impact**:
- Most relevant content surfaces first
- Eliminates noise from less relevant items
- Balances different content types

**Before vs After**:
```
BEFORE (no reranking):
  1. First mod found
  2. First register found
  3. Most relevant knowledge ← buried!

AFTER (with reranking):
  1. Most relevant knowledge (score: 18)
  2. Most relevant register (score: 15)
  3. Most relevant mod (score: 12)
```

## 🎬 Complete Workflow Example

### Scenario: "Implement sprite collision detection"

**1. User Prompt Submit Hook**
```
User Query: "Implement sprite collision detection"

Codex Analysis:
  - Topics: sprite, collision, detection, hitbox
  - Intent: implement
  - Related: OAM, coordinates, bounding box

Query Expansion:
  1. "Implement sprite collision detection"
  2. "Implement sprite collision detection OAM"
  3. "Implement sprite collision detection object"

Recent Changes:
  - sprite.c (modified)
  - player.c (modified)

RAG Retrieval (3 queries):
  Query 1 → 4 items
  Query 2 → 5 items (OAM focused)
  Query 3 → 3 items (sprite focused)

Deduplication → 8 unique items
Reranking → Top 5 by relevance

Context Injected:
  🤖 Codex Analysis: implement sprite collision...
  📝 Working on: sprite.c, player.c
  🧠 RAG Context:
    - Sprite System component
    - OAM attribute structure
    - Collision detection knowledge
    - OAMADDR register
    - Past learning: "Sprite coordinates in OAM"
```

**2. Claude Decides to Modify sprite.c**

**3. Pre-Tool Use Hook (before editing)**
```
File: sprite.c

RAG Context for sprite.c:
  - Component: Sprite rendering system
  - Past learning: OAM DMA patterns
  - Related register: OAMDATA ($2104)

Codex Analysis of sprite.c:
  - Purpose: Sprite management and OAM handling
  - Patterns: DMA transfer during VBlank
  - Considerations: Maintain 60 FPS, use table for tracking

Context injected before Claude edits
```

**4. Claude Edits sprite.c**

**5. Post-Tool Use Hook (after editing)**
```
Codex Change Analysis:
  - Implemented: Bounding box collision check
  - Decision: Use rectangular hitboxes
  - Pattern: Early-exit optimization
  - Consideration: Need to call every frame

Learning Extraction:
  Topic: "Sprite collision with bounding boxes"
  Content: "Implemented rectangular bounding box collision...
           Uses early-exit when sprites far apart..."
  Type: implementation
  Tags: ["c", "sprite", "collision"]

Stored in Neo4j:
  ✅ Knowledge node created
  ✅ Linked to Sprite component
  ✅ Available for future RAG queries

Code Quality Check:
  ✅ C syntax: PASSED
```

**6. Next Time You Ask About Collisions**

The learning from step 5 is now available:
```
Query: "How to optimize collision detection?"

RAG retrieves:
  - Knowledge: "Sprite collision with bounding boxes"
    (The learning we just stored!)
  - Shows your implementation pattern
  - Claude builds on your work
```

## 🚀 Performance Characteristics

### Hook Latency

- More complex code to maintain
- Dependency on Codex CLI

**Benefits**:
- Much higher quality context
- Better understanding of intent
- More relevant results
- Continuous learning

**Verdict**: Worth it for production use where quality > speed

## 📈 Quality Improvements

### Context Relevance

**Before**:
- Keyword matching only
- First N results returned
- Often mixed quality
- Missing related concepts

**After**:
- Intent-aware retrieval
- Synonym expansion
- Relevance-ranked results
- Related concepts included

**Example Impact**:
```
Query: "sprite priority"

Before:
  - Mod: max-hearts (mentioned "sprite" ← weak match)
  - Register: INIDISP (mentioned "priority" ← weak match)
  - Component: Player (mentions sprites ← okay match)

After:
  - Knowledge: "Sprite priority in OAM byte 3" (perfect match!)
  - Register: OBJSEL (sprite-related, high score)
  - Component: Sprite System (high relevance)
```

### Coverage Improvements

**Before**:
- Single query variation
- Keyword-only matching
- Missed synonyms

**After**:
- 3 query variations
- Synonym expansion
- Codex-guided concepts

**Example**:
```
Query: "PPU setup"

Before (1 variation):
  - Finds 3-5 items about "PPU"

After (3 variations):
  Variation 1: "PPU setup" → PPU items
  Variation 2: "PPU setup graphics" → rendering items
  Variation 3: "PPU setup video" → display items
  Combined → 8-12 unique items
```

## 🛠️ Configuration Guide

### Quick Toggles

**Disable Codex Analysis** (faster, less intelligent):
```python
# In .claude/hooks/user_prompt_submit.py, line ~341
if len(user_prompt) > 1000:  # Effectively disabled
    query_analysis = analyze_query_with_codex(user_prompt)
```

**Reduce Query Variations** (faster, less coverage):
```python
# In .claude/hooks/user_prompt_submit.py, line ~203
return expanded[:2]  # Was 3
```

**Adjust Relevance Weights** (tune for your domain):
```python
# In tools/neo4j_rag.py, line ~271
score += min(matches * 3, 15)  # Was: matches * 2, max 10
```

**Limit Max Results** (faster, less context):
```python
# In .claude/hooks/user_prompt_submit.py, line ~273
context = get_rag_context(query, max_items=5)  # Was 3
```

### Advanced Customization

**Add Custom Synonyms**:
```python
# In .claude/hooks/user_prompt_submit.py
synonyms = {
    # Add your project-specific terms
    "link": ["player", "hero"],
    "dungeon": ["palace", "temple"],
}
```

**Add Custom Scoring Factors**:
```python
# In tools/neo4j_rag.py, calculate_relevance_score()
# Add factor 5: Recent activity boost
if item.get("last_accessed"):
    days_ago = (now - item["last_accessed"]).days
    if days_ago < 7:
        score += 2  # Recently used
```

**Add Intent-Based Filtering**:
```python
# In tools/neo4j_rag.py, rerank_results()
if intent == "implement":
    # Boost code examples
    if "example" in item.get("content", ""):
        score += 5
```
